\section*{Problem 12: }
\section*{Problem 13: }
A possible modification to the CREW parallel all pairs shortest
path algorithm would be to perform the minimization step in 
alternate, thereby removing the concurent read of the distance
table.\\\\
As each processor finds the minimum for the first $2^n$ length
paths, it can also label the entry in the distance table with the
node that resulted in the minimum entry.  Starting from the initial
node, the actual path can then be recovered by following the 
list of labels.
