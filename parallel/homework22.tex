\section*{Problem 4: }
The algorithm that can be used in order to get parallel prefix to run in {O(log n)} time is called Scan. It is an established parallel 
pattern that is used when the main goal is to compute partial reductions of the entire collection, however in order to Scan to work 
correctly the operators used must be associative.\\\\
The basic idea of scan is to first compute the sums of every two elements in the collection, i.e. (1+2), (3+4), (5+6), {$\cdots$} The second step is to then sum these values with each other, so (1+2)+(3+4), (5+6)+(7+8), {$\cdots$} The third step is to then bring the first element down into its respective spot in the final collection, and continue the pattern of adding the previous summations
[(1+2)+(3+4)]+[(5+6)+(7+8)]. The fourth step is to then take [(1+2)+(3+4)]+(5+6). The final step is to then add [(1+2)]+3, [(3+4)]+5, and [(5+6)]+7.\\\\
At each level of Scan there are no data dependencies to worry about, which means that the calculations at each level can be done in parallel. Unfortunately because we are limited to {$n/\log n$} processors at each level we will have to do potentially {$n/p$} work. With {$\log n$} levels and {$n/p$} work at each level, the total runtime for this algorithm is {$O(n/p + n/\log n)$}.
\section*{Problem 6: }
\subsection*{A:}
Given $n^2$ processors on a CREW PRAM a \BigO(n) parallel algorithm
can be developed for matrix multiplication.  The technique used to 
create this algorithm is the fabled \textit{stare at the serial code}
method.  In this case, the serial code for matrix multiplication is as
follows:\\\\
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetKw{Func}{Function:}
\SetKw{Inp}{Input:}
\SetKw{Ret}{Return:}
\Func{\textit{Serial Matrix Mult}}\\
\Inp{\textit{Matrix $A_{n\times n}$, Matrix $B_{n\times n}$}}\\
\textit{Zero Matrix $C_{n\times n}$}\\
\For{\textit{i=0 to n}}
{\For{\textit{j=0 to n}}
{\For{\textit{k=0 to n}}
{\textit{C[i,j] += A[i,k]*B[k,j]}}
}
}
\Ret{\textit{C}}
\end{algorithm}
Given $n^2$ processors, the outer two loops can be parallelized easily
since there is no data dependence between them and concurrent reading
is allowed.  This gives the following algorithm:\\\\
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetKw{Func}{Function:}
\SetKw{Inp}{Input:}
\SetKw{Ret}{Return:}
\Func{\textit{Serial Matrix Mult}}\\
\Inp{\textit{Matrix $A_{n\times n}$, Matrix $B_{n\times n}$}}\\
\textit{Zero Matrix $C_{n\times n}$}\\
\tcc{PRAGMA: parallel for}
\For{\textit{i=0 to n}}
{\tcc{PRAGMA: parallel for}
    \For{\textit{j=0 to n}}
{\For{\textit{k=0 to n}}
{\textit{C[i,j] += A[i,k]*B[k,j]}}
}
}
\Ret{\textit{C}}\\
\end{algorithm}
Since giving a processor to the first two loops exhausts the number
of available processors, the processors given to the inner loop
must each carry out the $n$ multiplications and summations
needed for \textit{C[i,j]}.  This leads to a runtime of \BigO{n} for 
this algorithm.\\\\
The efficiency of this algorithm can be found by the following equation:
\[
    E(n,p) = \frac{S(n)}{pT(n,p)}
\]
Where \textit{S(n)} is the serial run time for the problem and \textit{T(n,p)}
is the parallel run time using \textit{p} processors.  Using the values for the
above algorith, \textit{E(n,p)} can be found to be:
\[
    E(n,p) = \frac{S(n)}{pT(n,p)} = \frac{n^3}{n^2 n} = 1
\]
This algorithm is therefore perfectly efficient.\\\\
However, if the number of processors is reduced to $n^{1/4}$ the folding
principle can be used to derive an upper bound on the new run time of 
this parallel algorithms.  Since the number of processors decreased,
the amoung of work each remaining processor must do increases.  As
a result, the new run will be at most $n^{11/4}$.
\subsection*{B:}
Similar to the algorithm given in \textbf{A}, an algorithm for 
matrix multiplication that runs in \BigO{\log n} time can be
developed using $n^3$ processors.  The primary modification
to the algorithm in \textbf{A} is that the innermost loop
can now be parallelized as a variation of the parallel SUM
problem which takes \BigO{\log n} through a divide and conquer
strategy.  The variation to the parallel sum in this case
is that initially the processors will multiply as the first
operation and then sum.
In this case, the algorithm is as follows:
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetKw{Func}{Function:}
\SetKw{Inp}{Input:}
\SetKw{Ret}{Return:}
\Func{\textit{Serial Matrix Mult}}\\
\Inp{\textit{Matrix $A_{n\times n}$, Matrix $B_{n\times n}$}}\\
\textit{Zero Matrix $C_{n\times n}$}\\
\tcc{PRAGMA: parallel for}
\For{\textit{i=0 to n}}
{\tcc{PRAGMA: parallel for}
    \For{\textit{j=0 to n}}
{
   \textit{C[i,j]} = \textit{ParallelDotProduct($row_i(A)$,$col_j(B)$,n)}\\ 
}
}
\Ret{\textit{C}}
\end{algorithm}
The runtime of this algorithm is analyzed in the same way as
the algorithm developed in \textbf{A}.  Since the two outer 
loops are completely parallelized, the occur in constant time.
Most of the work will be done within the ParallelDotProduct
function, which, like the parallel SUM, problem takes \BigO{\log n}
time.  As a result, the overall runtime of this algorithm is
\BigO{\log n}.\\\\
The efficiency of this algorithm is also calculated in an 
identical manner.  Substituting the appropriate values for
this algorithm into the above equation results in the
following efficiency calculation:
\[
    E(n,p) = \frac{S(n)}{pT(n,p)} = \frac{n^3}{n^3 \log n} = \frac{1}{\log n}
\]
If the number of processors is reduced to $n^{1/4}$, the folding principle
can be used to derive an upper bound on the new runtime.  Since the number
of processors has decreased, the remaining processors will now have to do 
more work.  The factor by which the processors decreased is $n^{11/4}$.
As a result the runtime of the algorithm on these constrained resources
will be at most $n^{11/4} \log n$
\subsection*{C:}
If only $n^3 / \log n$ processors are available, the algorithm
developed in \textbf{B} can still be used to perform parallel matrix
multiplication in \BigO{\log n} time.  This is because, $n^2$ processors
will still be used to parallelize the outermost loops for matrix
multiplication.  The remaining $n/\log n$ processors will then be
given to the \textit{ParallelDotProduct} problem.  Like the 
\textit{ParallelSum} problem, the run time of the problem stays the
same despite the reduction of processors because the recursive,
divide and conquer tree becomes shallower; however, the amount of 
work done at the leaves increases.\\\\
Given these factors, the algorithm for this problem is identical to
the one given in \textbf{B}, but is repeated here for clarity.\\\\
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetKw{Func}{Function:}
\SetKw{Inp}{Input:}
\SetKw{Ret}{Return:}
\Func{\textit{Serial Matrix Mult}}\\
\Inp{\textit{Matrix $A_{n\times n}$, Matrix $B_{n\times n}$}}\\
\textit{Zero Matrix $C_{n\times n}$}\\
\tcc{PRAGMA: parallel for}
\For{\textit{i=0 to n}}
{\tcc{PRAGMA: parallel for}
    \For{\textit{j=0 to n}}
{
   \textit{C[i,j]} = \textit{ParallelDotProduct($row_i(A)$,$col_j(B)$,n)}\\ 
}
}
\Ret{\textit{C}}
\end{algorithm}
Substituting the appropriate values into the efficiency calculation
for this algorithm reveals an improvement in the efficiency as 
compared to the conditions given in \textbf{B}.
\[
    E(n,p) = \frac{S(n)}{pT(n,p)} = \frac{n^3 \log n}{n^3 \log n} = 1 
\]
Under these conditions, the algorithm is perfectly efficient.\\\\
The folding principle can be once again applied to this problem to
place an upper bound on the runtime of this algorithm under the more
restrictive conditions of having only $n^{1/4}$ processors. Similar to 
problem \textbf{B}, the runtime will be no worse than $n^{11/4}$ because        
the number of processors decreased by a factor of $n^{11/4}/ \log n$.
