\section*{Problem 4: }
The algorithm that can be used in order to get parallel prefix to run in {O(log n)} time is called Scan. It is an established parallel 
pattern that is used when the main goal is to compute partial reductions of the entire collection, however in order to Scan to work 
correctly the operators used must be associative.\\\\
