In order to prove that problem (c) is NP-Hard, we need to reduce an NP-Complete problem to (c). We will call (c) {$Algo$}, where the input to {$Algo$} is a graph H and an integer j. The problem that will be reduced to {$Algo$} is Independent Set, in this problem we will use the abbreviation {$IS$}.\\\\
The basic idea of this reduction is to transform the input of {$IS$}, a graph G and an integer k, to the input for {$Algo$} and then return the output from {$Algo$}.\\
The reduction is as follows: \\\\
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetKw{Func}{Algorithm}
\Func{IS(graph G, integer k)}\\
{$H =  G$ + a Clique of size k, where each vertex in the Clique is connected to each vertex in the graph G}\\
{$j = k$}\\
{$return$  $Algo(H, j)$}
\end{algorithm}
