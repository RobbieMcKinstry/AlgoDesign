\subsection*{a}
Determining if a graph $\mathcal{G}$ with $n$
vertices has a clique of size $\frac{3n}{4}$ can be shown to be
\textbf{NP-Hard} by reducing any problem belonging to the set
\textbf{NP-Complete} to this problem, which will be called \textit{$\frac{3}{4}\ Clique$}.
In this case, the chosen problem will be the \textit{k-Clique} problem.
\[
k-Clique \leq_{p} \frac{3}{4}\ Clique
\]
For this reduction, the input of \textit{k-Clique} must be transformed
into an input for $\frac{3}{4}\ Clique$.  This transformation must
consider three different cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When the clique size given to \textit{k-Clique} is larger than
          $\frac{3n}{4}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.
    \item When the clique size given to \textit{k-Clique} is less than
          $\frac{3n}{4}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.   
    \item When the clique size given to \textit{k-Clique} is equal to 
          $\frac{3n}{4}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.   
\end{enumerate}
$Case\ 3$ is the easiest to handle since the input to \textit{k-Clique}
can be given directly to $\frac{3}{4}\ Clique$.  If the output of 
$\frac{3}{4}\ Clique$ is true, then \textit{k-Clique} also returns true.
Otherwise it returns false.\\\\
$Case\ 1$ and $Case\ 2$ are more involved; however, they can be handled
simulatenously.  When the input to \textit{k-Clique} is larger, disjoint
vertices can be added to the graph inorder to increase the number of vertices,
thereby lowering the ratio.  In the case when the input is smaller, the
Clique being requested can be grown by $1$ by adding a vertex and 
connecting all vertices in the original graph to the new vertex.
All of these transformations are captured in the following algorithm.\\\\    
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetKw{Func}{Function:}
\SetKw{Inp}{Input:}
\SetKw{Glob}{Globals:}
\SetKw{Ret}{Return:}
\Func{Clique}\\
\Inp{Graph G, int k}\\
\tcc{$V_G$ is the number of vertrices in graph G}
\While{$k \neq 0.75V_G$}
{
    \uIf{$k > 0.75V_G$}
    {
        \tcc{argument $G$ is modified through function}
        add\_disjoint\_vertex($G$)   
    }
    \Else{
        \tcc{argument $G$ is modified through function}
        add\_connected\_vertex($G$)\\
        $k$++
    }
}
\Ret{$\frac{3}{4}\ Clique(G)$}
\end{algorithm}
Two conditions for this reduction must be satisfied: the necessary and sufficient
condition on the transformation and the polynomial time bound on the transformation.
The necessary and sufficient condition can be proven by construction of graphs.  A
runtime analysis of the algorithm shows that there are only $2$ loops in this 
algorithm.  The outerloop determines if the process has converged and an implicit
loop is used to determine how many vertices are in the graph.  As a result, this
reduction shows $\frac{3}{4}\ Clique(G)$ is \textbf{NP-Hard}.
