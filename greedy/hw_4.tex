\section{Problem 9:}
\subsection{A}

The algorithm whereby the skier and ski whose height difference
is minimized gets assigned first and then the process is repeated
is incorrect.\\\\
Consider the following counter example:\\\\
Skiers = $\{1,2,3\}$\\
Skis = $\{2.5, 2.6, 3.6\}$\\\\
This greedy algorithm will produce the following pairings:\\\\
(Skiers, Skis) = $\{(1,3.6),(2,2.5),(3,2.6)\}$\\
This has an average height difference of $3.5/3$.\\
The optimal pairing would be:\\\\
(Skiers, Skis) = $\{(1,2.5),(2,2.6),(3,3.6)\}$\\
This has an average height difference of $2.7/3$

\subsection{A}
This greedy algorithm can be shown to be correct using an
exchange argument.\\\\
Let $Alg$ be the process by which the greedy algorithm operates.
Assume there exists some input $I$ such that $Alg(I)$ is incorrect.
Let $Opt(I)$ be the optimal output for input $I$ that agrees with
$Alg(I)$ for the greatest number of steps.\\\\
Since $Opt(I)$ cannot equal $Alg(I)$, there must be an earliest
step of disagreement.  Label this step $i$.
